CropWise: Crop Recommender System ðŸŒ±

CropWise is a machine learning-powered web application that helps farmers make informed crop selection decisions based on soil and climate parameters. It uses a trained Random Forest model to recommend the most suitable crops for specified environmental conditions.

Features=

1.User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

2.Inputs include soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall.

3.Predicts optimal crop recommendation using a trained Random Forest classifier.

4.Robust error handling for model loading and prediction.

5.Interactive input forms with intuitive layouts.
