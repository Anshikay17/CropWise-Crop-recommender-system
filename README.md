CropWise: Crop Recommender System ðŸŒ±
CropWise is a machine learning-powered web application that helps farmers make informed crop selection decisions based on soil and climate parameters. It uses a trained Random Forest model to recommend the most suitable crops for specified environmental conditions.

Features
User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
Inputs include soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall.
Predicts optimal crop recommendation using a trained Random Forest classifier.
Robust error handling for model loading and prediction.
Interactive input forms with intuitive layouts.
